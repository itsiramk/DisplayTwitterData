# DisplayTwitterData

This is a Kotlin Project.

Fetch the list of tweets from the server and show it in the list. Users should also be able to search locally from the tweets fetched from the server.

Features:

User should be able to see the most recent tweets that match the search text. The list of tweets should include the following details:
